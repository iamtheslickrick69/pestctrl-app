- Better: "15 homes on Oak Street signed up this month - mosquitos down 90%!"

#### 3. **More Specific Personalization**
- Use customer notes more effectively
- Reference property details
- Mention specific seasons/events

#### 4. **Better Objection Pre-emption**

**After:**
> "Hi Sarah! Anna from PestCtrl - we've missed you! I know price was a concern, so here's what I can do: 50% off first 2 months ($45 instead of $89), PLUS lock you in at $74/month for the year (instead of our new $89 rate). That's $180 saved.

**After:**
> "Hi Mark! Quick heads-up from PestCtrl - your $256 payment didn't process (probably just an expired card?). No worries! Want me to send you a secure link to update it? Takes 30 seconds, then you're all set. Or I can try the card again if you'd prefer?"

**Overall Assessment: GOOD FOUNDATION, NEEDS REFINEMENT**

The bot is functional and handles objections well, but needs more persuasive, personalized messaging to hit 40% response rates and 5% conversion targets.

Implementing the refined messages below should increase:
- Response rates: 25% → 40%
- Conversion rates: 3% → 5%
- Average deal size: +15%
