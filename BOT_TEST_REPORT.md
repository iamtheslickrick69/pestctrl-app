**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Status:** ✅ ALL TESTS PASSING

---

## 🔍 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: Stats Not Tracking
**Problem:** Total Conversations counter stayed at 0
**Root Cause:** `startConversation()` function didn't increment the stat
**Fix:** Added stats update when conversation starts
**Location:** `app/conversations/page.tsx:66-69`

```typescript
// Added:
setStats(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  totalConversations: prev.totalConversations + 1
}))
```

**Result:** ✅ Stats now track correctly

     I know price was a concern last time, so here's
     what I can do: 50% OFF first 2 months ($67 instead
     of $135), PLUS lock you in at $74/month..."

Customer: "I left because of the price"

AI: "I totally understand - that's EXACTLY why I'm calling!
     This offer is specifically for valued former customers
     like you. $74/month locked in for the year is $15/month
     less than our current $89 rate."

Customer: "yes restart"

AI: "Awesome! First 2 months at $67/month, then locked in
     at $74/month for the remaining 10 months. Total first

AI: "Mark, I totally get it - life happens! Here's what
     I can do: Split it in two payments of $128. I'll
