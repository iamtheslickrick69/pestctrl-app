# ðŸ¤– PestCtrl AI Sales Bot - Local MVP Demo Guide

## âœ… What's Built

You now have a **fully functional AI sales bot** demonstrating all 4 revenue streams:

1. **Upselling Current Customers** (Mosquito treatment add-on)
2. **Win-Back Lost Customers** (50% discount offers)
3. **Collections & Payment Recovery** (Diplomatic payment recovery)
4. **Retention & Preventive Save** (Service issue resolution)

## ðŸš€ How to Use the Demo

### Access the Conversations Dashboard

1. **Open your browser**: http://localhost:8080/conversations

2. **You'll see 8 mock customers**, each representing a different revenue stream scenario:
   - **Green badges** = Upsell opportunities
   - **Blue badges** = Win-back candidates
   - **Orange badges** = Collections needed
   - **Purple badges** = Retention scenarios

## ðŸ“Š What the AI Does

### Contextual Intelligence
- **Knows customer history**: Service dates, current services, payment status
- **Adapts to revenue stream**: Different approach for upsell vs collections
- **Handles objections**: Price concerns, effectiveness questions, timing issues
- **Detects conversions**: Automatically tracks when deals close

### Natural Conversations
- Uses customer's first name
- References specific details (property, services, dates)
- Offers multiple solutions
- Never pushy, always helpful
- Maintains professional tone

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### What's Running:
1. **Next.js App** (http://localhost:8080) - Your web dashboard
2. **n8n** (http://localhost:5678) - Workflow automation platform (running in background)
3. **Mock Customer Database** (`lib/mockCustomers.ts`) - 8 test customers
4. **Sales Bot Engine** (`lib/salesBotEngine.ts`) - AI conversation logic
5. **API Routes** (`app/api/sms/route.ts`) - Handles conversations

### File Structure:
```
/Users/isr/Desktop/pestctrl-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mockCustomers.ts           # Customer database
