## üéì Sales Psychology Principles Applied

### 1. **Scarcity & Urgency**
- "Only 3 slots left this week"
- "Fully booked by mid-May"
- "This week only"

### 2. **Social Proof**
- "15 neighbors on your street already signed up"
- "Most customers tell us their backyard became usable again"
- "I've done this for tons of customers"

### 3. **Loss Aversion**
- "$732 saved" (emphasize loss if they don't act)
- "Summer is when mosquitos get BAD"
- "Way cheaper to prevent than to fix"

### 4. **Anchoring**
- "That's only $1.30/day" (vs $39/month)
- "Most customers spend $50-80 on bug spray that doesn't even work"
- "$39/month is less than dinner out"

### 5. **Reciprocity**
- Free re-treatments
- 50% off credits
- "I'll refund you personally"

### 6. **Specificity**
- Exact numbers ("15 neighbors", "90% reduction")
- Specific dates ("Thursday's visit", "tomorrow morning")
- Precise calculations ($732 saved, $1.30/day)
